Lens Flares for Godot

To add to your project just copy the addons folder into your project's root directory. To add a lens flare to your 3D scene go under Spatial and find FlareEmitter. To see the lens flare your project has to be running, the flares are not viewable in the editor. The amount of flares the FlareEmitter has is dependent on the textures put into the Flare Emitter. The more textures, the more flares. The Flare Colors, Flare Scale, and Rotate Flare settings are also arrays, the number each setting in the arrays corresponds to the texture array numbers. You don't need to put in every setting, there are default settings for flares that don't have a corresponding number in each array.
